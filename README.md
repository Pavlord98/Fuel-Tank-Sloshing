# Fuel-Tank-Sloshing

This set of simulations focuses on water sloshing in a tank with and withour baffles. This project is based on and inspired by [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286940327_Design_of_fuel_tank_baffles_to_reduce_kinetic_energy_produced_by_fuel_sloshing_and_to_enhance_the_product_life_cycle).
